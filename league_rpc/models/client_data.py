"""
This module defines the ClientData class, a data structure designed to hold comprehensive
client-related information about a player's session in League of Legends. This class is particularly
useful for tracking real-time client state and player statistics, encapsulating everything from the
current game mode to the player's ranked stats across different game formats.


Usage:
    The ClientData class is integral to systems that require monitoring or displaying real-time information
    about a playerâ€™s current game status or session details. It is especially useful in client applications,
    overlays, and tools that provide enhanced player experiences by utilizing live data to offer insights,
    stats tracking, and session analysis.
